## Why multilevel social epidemiology?

::: columns
::: {.column width="55%"}
-   Place-based comparisons of health are revealing (Villerm√©, Farr, Graunt, Snow, DuBois, many others)

-   Communities inherently reflect social dynamics.

-   Host-Agent-Environment (physical and social).

-   "Population perspective", contra biomedical individualism.

-   Strong theory, field measurements, sophisticated models, potential mechanisms linked to violent crime.

> Multilevel analyses showed that a measure of collective efficacy yields a high between-neighborhood reliability and is negatively associated with variations in violence, when individual-level characteristics, measurement error, and prior violence are controlled. Associations of concentrated disadvantage and residential instability with violence are largely mediated by collective efficacy.

Potential:

## State of the Evidence: 2001

-   25 studies but only 10 used multilevel models, however...

> In 23 of the 25 studies we identified, researchers reported a *statistically significant association* between at least one neighbourhood measure of socioeconomic status and health, controlling for individual socioeconomic status.

-   Potential for intervention:

> ...serve the purpose of identifying types of geographical areas where traditional public health interventions, aimed at individual risk reduction, may best be targeted.

    -   Other outcomes mixed, some positive, some negative.

-   Many limitations.

## Summary: What have we learned?

<br>

### Multilevel models

-   Helped to push social epi forward.
-   Perhaps short of promises.
-   More cross-sectional random effects designs unlikely to help.

### Neighborhood effects

-   Heterogeneous but reliably negative associations between adverse neighborhood conditions and health.
-   Particularly for children with longer exposure.
-   Potential underutilization of cluster-randomized interventions.
