[Act 1: The Big Idea]{.act}

## Introduction

How do misclassification, selection bias, and unmeasured confounding create bias in parameter estimation?

::: incremental
> By assuming that all errors are random and that any modeling assumptions (such as homogeneity) are correct, all uncertainty about the effect of errors on estimates is subsumed within conventional standard deviations for the estimates (standard errors), such as those given in earlier chapters (which assume no measurement error), and any discrepancy between an observed association and the target effect may be attributed to chance alone[^1]

-   Bias analysis is an attempt to quantify the potential for bias, and reduce the likelihood of mistakenly attributing effects to exposure rather than systematic error.

## O'Campo 1995

-   Used GEE (concerns about autocorrelation and correct SEs) citing Zeger.
-   'Confounding' of individual-level factors after adjustment for neighborhood-level
-   Contexual-factors can be helpful for targeting interventions (e.g., raising employment)

Merlo (2003):

> Traditional measures of association such as odds ratios thus provide an incomplete epidemiological basis for decision making in public health interventions.

O'Campo (2003):

> Perhaps the most pressing issue standing in the way of progress in multilevel research is lack of theory (i.e., system of hypotheses) on the mechanisms by which neighborhood environments affect health risks, protective factors, and outcomes.

Sharkey (2014):

> We argue that the literature on context effects should be designed to provide theory and evidence on how this process works, and on the consequences for individuals' and families' lives and life chances.

## Motivation

-   Need to discuss what MLM were helping to 'solve'
-   'Simultaneous adjustment'
-   Back to population perspective
-   Consistency with conceptual models of social determinants

## A skeptical view

Oakes:

> The recent and enthusiastic adoption of the multilevel model for neighborhood effects research appears to be a case of *statisticism*, a term used to describe an almost ritualistic appeal to significance testing and both sampling and measurement error when they are not the problem

## Epilogue: What have we learned?

-   Heterogeneous but reliably negative associations between adverse neighborhood conditions and health.

-   Strong commitment to the idea of 'neighborhood effects', but we haven't employed the right techniques to 'reveal' them.
