Notes on Readings

# Diez-Roux 2001 ARPH
- Interesting to see that she discusses the partial pooling, no pooling idea related to RE models (p.180).
- A lot of traction around the idea of *simultaneously* evaluating individual and cluster-level determinants of health.
- Key summary message: "multilevel models allow for the importance of both groups and individuals in understanding health outcomes." and to "overcome the limitations inherent in focusing only at one level."

# O'Campo 1995 AJPH

# Von Korff 1992 AJE
- Lays out the basic rationale and methods for incorporating higher-level variables in epi analysis.
- Again the key conceptual idea here is about "after controlling for individual-level covariates".
