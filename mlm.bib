	abstract = {In contrast to a large literature investigating neighborhood effects on health, few studies have examined health as a determinant of neighborhood attainment. However, the sorting of individuals into neighborhoods by health status is a substantively important process for multiple policy sectors. We use prospectively collected data on 569 poor, predominantly African American Hurricane Katrina survivors to examine the extent to which health problems predicted subsequent neighborhood poverty. Our outcome of interest was participants' 2009\textendash 2010 census tract poverty rate. Participants were coded as having a health problem at baseline (2003\textendash 2004) if they self-reported a diagnosis of asthma, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart problems, or any other physical health problems not listed, or complained of back pain, migraines, or digestive problems at baseline. Although health problems were not associated with neighborhood poverty at baseline, those with baseline health problems ended up living in higher poverty areas by 2009\textendash 2010. Differences persisted after adjustment for personal characteristics, baseline neighborhood poverty, hurricane exposure, and residence in the New Orleans metropolitan area, with baseline health problems predicting a 3.4 percentage point higher neighborhood poverty rate (95\% confidence interval: 1.41, 5.47). Results suggest that better health was protective against later neighborhood deprivation in a highly mobile, socially vulnerable population. Researchers should consider reciprocal associations between health and neighborhoods when estimating and interpreting neighborhood effects on health. Understanding whether and how poor health impedes poverty deconcentration efforts may help inform programs and policies designed to help low-income families move to\textemdash and stay in\textemdash higher opportunity neighborhoods.},

	abstract = {Neighborhood effects on health research has grown over the past 20 years. While the substantive findings of this literature have been published in systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and commentaries, operational details of the research have been understudied. We identified 7140 multi-level neighborhoods and health papers published on US populations between 1995 and 2014, and present data on the study characteristics of the 256 papers that met our inclusion criteria. Our results reveal rapid growth in neighborhoods and health research in the mid-2000s, illustrate the dominance of observational cross-sectional study designs, and show a heavy reliance on single-level, census-based neighborhood definitions. Socioeconomic indicators were the most commonly analyzed neighborhood variables and body mass was the most commonly studied health outcome. Well-known challenges associated with neighborhood effects research were infrequently acknowledged. We discuss how these results move the agenda forward for neighborhoods and health research.},

	abstract = {How does one's place of residence affect individual behavior and long-run outcomes? Understanding neighborhood and place effects has been a leading question for social scientists during the past half-century. Recent empirical studies using experimental and quasi-experimental research designs have generated new insights on the importance of residential neighborhoods in childhood and adulthood. This paper summarizes the recent neighborhood effects literature and interprets the findings. Childhood neighborhoods affect long-run economic and educational outcomes in a manner consistent with exposure models of neighborhood effects. For adults, neighborhood environments matter for their health and well-being but have more ambiguous impacts on labor market outcomes. We discuss the evidence on the mechanisms behind the observed patterns and conclude by highlighting directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Public health researchers are increasingly questioning the consequences of gentrification for population health and health equity, as witnessed in the rapid increase in public health publications on the health (equity) effects of gentrification. Despite methodological challenges, and mixed results from existing quantitative research, qualitative evidence to date points to the role of gentrification processes in exacerbating health inequities. Here we discuss past methodological and theoretical challenges in integrating the study of gentrification with public health research. We suggest taking an interdisciplinary approach, considering the conceptualization of gentrification in measurement techniques and conceiving this process as a direct exposure or as a part of broader neighborhood changes. Finally, we discuss existingpolicy approaches to mitigating and preventing gentrification and how these could be evaluated for effectiveness and as public health promotion and specifically as interventions to promote health equity.},

	abstract = {A large portion of current epidemiologic research is based on methodologic individualism: the notion that the distribution of health and disease in populations can be explained exclusively in terms of the characteristics of individuals. The present paper discusses the need to include group- or macro-level variables in epidemiologic studies, thus incorporating multiple levels of determination in the study of health outcomes. These types of analyses, which have been called contextual or multi-level analyses, challenge epidemiologists to develop theoretical models of disease causation that extend across levels and explain how group-level and individual-level variables interact in shaping health and disease. They also raise a series of methodological issues, including the need to select the appropriate contextual unit and contextual variables, to correctly specify the individual-level model, and, in some cases, to account for residual correlation between individuals within contexts. Despite its complexities, multilevel analysis holds potential for reemphasizing the role of macro-level variables in shaping health and disease in populations.},

	abstract = {Over the past few years there has been growing interest in considering factors defined at multiple levels in public health research. Multilevel analysis has emerged as one analytical strategy that may partly address this need, by allowing the simultaneous examination of group-level and individual-level factors. This paper reviews the rationale for using multilevel analysis in public health research, summarizes the statistical methodology, and highlights some of the research questions that have been addressed using these methods. The advantages and disadvantages of multi level analysis compared with standard methods are reviewed. The use of multilevel analysis raises theoretical and methodological issues related to the theoretical model being tested, the conceptual distinction between group and individual-level variables, the ability to differentiate ``independent'' effects, the reciprocal relationships between factors at different levels, and the increased complexity that these models imply. The potentialities and limitations of multilevel analysis, within the broader context of understanding the role of factors defined at multiple levels in shaping health outcomes, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Rationale Examining interactions between numerous interlocking social identities and the systems of oppression and privilege that shape them is central to health inequalities research. Multilevel models are an alternative and novel approach to examining health inequalities at the intersection of multiple social identities. This approach draws attention to the heterogeneity within and between intersectional social strata by partitioning the total variance across two levels. Method Utilizing a familiar empirical example from social epidemiology\textemdash body mass index among U.S. adults (N~=~32,788)\textemdash we compare the application of multilevel models to the conventional fixed effects approach to studying high-dimension interactions. Researchers are often confronted with the need to explore numerous interactions of identities and social processes. We explore the interactions of five dimensions of social identity and position\textemdash gender, race/ethnicity, income, education, and age\textemdash for a total of 384 unique intersectional social strata. Results We find that the multilevel approach provides advantages over conventional models, including scalability for higher dimensions, adjustment for sample size of social strata, model parsimony, and ease of interpretation. Conclusion Considerable variation is attributable to the within-strata level, indicating the low discriminatory accuracy of these intersectional identities and the high within-strata heterogeneity of risk that remains unexplained. Multilevel modeling is an innovative and valuable tool for evaluating the intersectionality of health inequalities.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To replicate a prior study that found greater adolescent marijuana use in states that have passed medical marijuana laws (MMLs), and extend this analysis by accounting for confounding by unmeasured state characteristics and measurement error. METHODS: We obtained state-level estimates of marijuana use from the 2002 through 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. We used 2-sample t-tests and random-effects regression to replicate previous results. We used difference-in-differences regression models to estimate the causal effect of MMLs on marijuana use, and simulations to account for measurement error. RESULTS: We replicated previously published results showing higher marijuana use in states with MMLs. Difference-in-differences estimates suggested that passing MMLs decreased past-month use among adolescents by 0.53 percentage points (95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-1.02) and had no discernible effect on the perceived riskiness of monthly use. Models incorporating measurement error in the state estimates of marijuana use yielded little evidence that passing MMLs affects marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for confounding by unmeasured state characteristics and measurement error had an important effect on estimates of the impact of MMLs on marijuana use. We find limited evidence of causal effects of MMLs on measures of reported marijuana use.},

	abstract = {{$\blacksquare$} Abstract\hspace{0.6em} It has now been over a quarter of a century since the publication of Mervyn Susser's Causal Thinking in the Health Sciences (1973, Oxford University Press), the first book-length treatment of causal reasoning and inference in our field. Major contributions of this work were its holistic focus on the origins of health outcomes in the context of ecologic systems and its invigoration of the literature on causal criteria in epidemiology. Although a recent resurgence of interest in social context has revivified many points made by Susser, a formal basis for causal analysis consistent with this ecologic perspective has failed to emerge in public health research. Susser's discussion of causal criteria, on the other hand, helped spur a vigorous dialogue that has persisted unabated to the present day. Although the basic outline of the criteria has evolved little, their applications, interrelations, and relative contributions to causal judgments have been the subject of continued and sometimes contentious debate.},

	abstract = {Investigating effects of discrimination upon health requires clear concepts, methods, and measures. At issue are both economic consequences of discrimination and accumulated insults arising from everyday and at times violent experiences of being treated as a second-class citizen, at each and every economic level. Guidelines for epidemiologic investigations and other public health research on ways people embody racism, sexism, and other forms of social inequality, however, are not well defined, as research in this area is in its infancy. Employing an ecosocial framework, this article accordingly reviews definitions and patterns of discrimination within the United States; evaluates analytic strategies and instruments researchers have developed to study health effects of different kinds of discrimination; and delineates diverse pathways by which discrimination can harm health, both outright and by distorting production of epidemiologic knowledge about determinants of population health. Three methods of studying health consequences of discrimination are examined (indirect; direct, at the individual level, in relation to personal experiences of discrimination; at the population level, such as via segregation), and recommendations are provided for developing research instruments to measure acute and cumulative exposure to different aspects of discrimination.},

	abstract = {There has been increasing interest in investigating whether inhabitants in socially or physically deprived neighborhoods have higher mortality when individual socioeconomic status is adjusted for. Results so far appear ambiguous and the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review of previous studies and to quantify the association between area-level socioeconomic status (ALSES) and all-cause mortality in a meta-analysis. Current guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses were followed. Articles were retrieved from Medline, Embase, Social Sciences Citation Index and PsycInfo and individually evaluated by two researchers. Only peer-reviewed multilevel studies from high-income countries, which analyzed the influence of at least one area-level indicator and which controlled for individual SES, were included. The ALSES estimates in each study were first combined into a single estimate using weighted linear regression. In the meta-analysis we calculated combined estimates with random effects to account for heterogeneity between studies. Out of the 40 studies found eligible for the systematic review 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The systematic review suggests that there is an association between social cohesion and mortality but found no evidence for a clear association for area-level income inequality or for social capital. Studies including more than one area level suggest that characteristics on different area levels contribute to individual mortality. In the meta-analysis we found significantly higher mortality among inhabitants living in areas with low ALSES. Associations were stronger for men and younger age groups and in studies analyzing geographical units with fewer inhabitants.},

@article{merlo2018,
	abstract = {Background Analyzing Body Mass Index as a didactical example, the study by Evans, Williams, Onnela, and Subramanian (EWOS study) introduce a novel methodology for the investigation of socioeconomic disparities in health. By using multilevel analysis to model health inequalities within and between strata defined by the intersection of multiple social and demographic dimensions, the authors provide a better understanding of the health heterogeneity existing in the population. Their innovative methodology allows for gathering inductive information on a large number of stratum-specific interactions of effects and, simultaneously, informs on the discriminatory accuracy of such strata for predicting individual health. Their study provides an excellent answer to the call for suitable quantitative methodologies within the intersectionality framework. Rationale The EWOS study is a well-written tutorial; thus, in this commentary, I will not repeat the explanation of the statistical/epidemiological concepts. Instead, I will share with the reader a number of thoughts on the theoretical consequences derived from the application of multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy (MAIHDA) in (social) epidemiology in general, and within the intersectional framework in particular. MAIHDA is a reorganization of concepts that allows for a better understanding of the distribution and determinants of individual health and disease risk in the population. Conclusions By applying MAIHD within an intersectional framework, the EWOS study provides a superior theoretical and quantitative instrument for documenting health disparities and it should become the new gold standard for investigating health disparities in (social) epidemiology. This approach is more appropriate for eco-social perspectives than the habitual probabilistic strategy based on differences between group average risks. However, both, the translation of intersectionality theory into (social) epidemiology and the intersectional quantitative methodology (especially for generalized linear models) are still under development.},

	abstract = {Objective Low neighbourhood socioeconomic status (NSES) has been linked to a higher risk of overweight/obesity, irrespective of the individual's own socioeconomic status. No meta-analysis study has been done on the association. Thus, this study was done to synthesise the existing evidence on the association of NSES with overweight, obesity and body mass index (BMI). Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Sciences and Google Scholar databases were searched for articles published until 25 September 2019. Eligibility criteria Epidemiological studies, both longitudinal and cross-sectional ones, which examined the link of NSES to overweight, obesity or BMI, were included. Data extraction and synthesis Data extraction was done by two reviewers, working independently. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for the observational studies. The summary estimates of the relationships of NSES with overweight, obesity and BMI statuses were calculated with random-effects meta-analysis models. Heterogeneity was assessed by Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Subgroup analyses were done by age categories, continents, study designs and NSES measures. Publication bias was assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger's regression test. Result A total of 21 observational studies, covering 1 244 438 individuals, were included in this meta-analysis. Low NSES, compared with high NSES, was found to be associated with a 31\% higher odds of overweight (pooled OR 1.31, 95\% CI 1.16 to 1.47, p{$<$}0.001), a 45\% higher odds of obesity (pooled OR 1.45, 95\% CI 1.21 to 1.74, p{$<$}0.001) and a 1.09 kg/m2 increase in mean BMI (pooled beta=1.09, 95\% CI 0.67 to 1.50, p{$<$}0.001). Conclusion NSES disparity might be contributing to the burden of overweight/obesity. Further studies are warranted, including whether addressing NSES disparity could reduce the risk of overweight/obesity. PROSPERO registration number CRD42017063889},

The evidence from scientific reviews leans towards the idea that it is likely that neighbourhoods indeed affect life chances of their residents. Yet, amongst scientists there is no consensus about the neighbourhood effects hypothesis because of differences in methodological and theoretical approaches. I ask why, when there is no consensus, the evidence leans towards supporting the neighbourhood effects hypothesis within policy circles. To test whether the scientific evidence for the neighbourhood effects hypothesis is driven by publication bias, I employ a meta-analysis over all studies that test for a relation between neighbourhood characteristics and educational outcomes. The results show that around the arbitrary boundary for statistical significance (p-value is less than 0.05), there is an unlikely large share of studies that are significant compared to the share of studies that are insignificant. This finding strongly suggests that there is publication bias in the neighbourhood effects literature.},

An electronic keyword literature search identified 1369 empirical and methodological neighborhood effects papers published in 112 relevant journals between 1990 and 2014. Analyses of temporal trends were conducted by focus, journal type (e.g., epidemiology, public health, or social science), and specific epidemiologic journal. Select papers were then critically reviewed. Results show an ever-increasing number of papers published, notably since the year 2000, with the majority published in public health journals. The variety of health outcomes analyzed is extensive, ranging from infectious disease to obesity to criminal behavior. Papers relying on data from experimental designs are thought to yield the most credible results, but such studies are few and findings are inconsistent. Papers relying on data from observational designs and multilevel models typically show small statistically significant effects, but most fail to appreciate fundamental identification problems. Ultimately, of the 1170 empirically focused neighborhood effects papers published in the last 24~years, only a handful have clearly advanced our understanding of the phenomena. The independent impact of neighborhood contexts on health remains unclear. It is time to expand the social epidemiological imagination.},

The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the application of appropriate multi-level analytic methods and discuss their implications for public health. METHODS. A previously published individual-level model of physical violence perpetrated by male partners during the childbearing year was reanalyzed to include variables describing the neighborhoods where the women resided. Logistic regression with estimation methods of the generalized estimating equation was used for the contextual analysis. To assess the advantages of the generalized estimating equation over conventional logistic regression, both were used for the two-level model. RESULTS. The regression coefficients from the contextual model differed from the betas obtained in the individual-level model. Not only were neighborhood-level variables related to the risk of partner-perpetrated violence, but the presence of these macro-level variables in the models modified the relationships of the individual-level variables to the risk of violence. CONCLUSIONS. Two-level models that include individual- and community-level factors may be beneficial for purposes of explanation in public health research.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Past research on low birthweight has focused on individual-level risk factors. We sought to assess the contribution of macrolevel social factors by using census tract-level data on social stratification, community empowerment, and environmental stressors. METHODS: Census tract-level information on social risk was linked to birth certificate records from Baltimore, Md, for the period 1985 through 1989. Individual level factors included maternal education, maternal age, medical assistance health insurance (Medicaid), and trimester of prenatal care initiation. Methods of multilevel modeling using two-stage regression analyses were employed. RESULTS: Macrolevel factors had both direct associations and interactions with low birthweight. All individual risk factors showed interaction with macrolevel variables; that is, individual-level risk factors for low birthweight behaved differently depending upon the characteristics of the neighborhood of residence. For example, women living in high-risk neighborhoods benefited less from prenatal care than did women living in lower-risk neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel modeling is an important tool that allows simultaneous study of macro- and individual-level risk factors. Multilevel analyses should play a larger role in the formulation of public health policies.},

	abstract = {There have been significant developments in epidemiologic methodology during the past century, including changes in basic concepts, methods of data analysis, and methods of exposure measurement. However, the rise of modern epidemiology has been a mixed blessing, and the new paradigm has major shortcomings, both in public health and in scientific terms. The changes in the paradigm have not been neutral but have rather helped change--and have reflected changes in--the way in which epidemiologists think about health and disease. The key issue has been the shift in the level of analysis from the population to the individual. Epidemiology has largely ceased to function as part of a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the causation of disease in populations and has become a set of generic methods for measuring associations of exposure and disease in individuals. This reductionist approach focuses on the individual, blames the victim, and produces interventions that can be harmful. We seem to be using more and more advanced technology to study more and more trivial issues, while the major causes of disease are ignored. Epidemiology must reintegrate itself into public health and must rediscover the population perspective.},

Overall, 86 studies were inventoried. Although several innovative methodological approaches and analytical designs were found, small areas are most often operationalised using administrative and statistical spatial units. Most studies used indicators of area socioeconomic status derived from censuses, and few provided information on the validity and reliability of measures of exposures. A consistent finding was that a significant portion of the variation in health is associated with area context independently of individual characteristics. Area effects on health, although significant in most studies, often depend on the health outcome studied, the measure of area exposure used, and the spatial scale at which associations are examined.},

	abstract = {Disparities in verbal ability, a major predictor of later life outcomes, have generated widespread debate, but few studies have been able to isolate neighborhood-level causes in a developmentally and ecologically appropriate way. This study presents longitudinal evidence from a large-scale study of {$>$}2,000 children ages 6\textendash 12 living in Chicago, along with their caretakers, who were followed wherever they moved in the U.S. for up to 7 years. African-American children are exposed in such disproportionate numbers to concentrated disadvantage that white and Latino children cannot be reliably compared, calling into question traditional research strategies assuming common points of overlap in ecological risk. We therefore focus on trajectories of verbal ability among African-American children, extending recently developed counterfactual methods for time-varying causes and outcomes to adjust for a wide range of predictors of selection into and out of neighborhoods. The results indicate that living in a severely disadvantaged neighborhood reduces the later verbal ability of black children on average by {$\approx$} 4 points, a magnitude that rivals missing a year or more of schooling.},

Although the empirical evidence for a lack of comparability between correlations derived from ecological- and individual-level analyses is compelling, the conceptual meaning of the ecological fallacy remains problematic. This paper argues that issues in cross-level inference can be usefully conceptualized as validity problems, problems not peculiar to ecological-level analyses. Such an approach increases the recognition of both potential inference problems in individual-level studies and the unique contributions of ecological variables. This, in turn, expands the terrain for the location of causes for disease and interventions to improve the public's health.},

We argue that this question has had a disproportionate influence on the field and does not align with the complexity of theoretical models of neighborhood effects or empirical findings that have arisen from the literature. In this article, we focus on empirical work that considers how different dimensions of individuals' residential contexts become salient in their lives, how contexts influence individuals' lives over different timeframes, how individuals are affected by social processes operating at different scales, and how residential contexts influence the lives of individuals in heterogeneous ways. In other words, we review research that examines where, when, why, and for whom do residential contexts matter. Using the large literature on neighborhoods and educational and cognitive outcomes as an example, the research we review suggests that any attempt to reduce the literature to a single answer about whether neighborhoods matter is misguided. We call for a more flexible study of context effects in which theory, measurement, and methods are more closely aligned with the specific mechanisms and social processes under study.},

	abstract = {Structural racism has resulted in long-standing disinvestment and dilapidated environmental conditions in Black neighborhoods. Abandoned houses signal neglect and foster stress and fear for residents, weakening social ties and potentially contributing to poor health and safety.To determine whether abandoned house remediation reduces gun violence and substance-related outcomes and increases perceptions of safety and use of outdoor space.This cluster randomized trial was conducted from January 2017 to August 2020, with interventions occurring between August 2018 and March 2019. The study included abandoned houses across Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and surveys completed by participants living nearby preintervention and postintervention. Data analysis was performed from March 2021 to September 2022.The study consisted of 3 arms: (1) full remediation (installing working windows and doors, cleaning trash, weeding); (2) trash cleanup and weeding only; and (3) a no-intervention control.Difference-in-differences mixed-effects regression models were used to estimate the effect of the interventions on multiple primary outcomes: gun violence (weapons violations, gun assaults, and shootings), illegal substance trafficking and use, public drunkenness, and perceptions of safety and time outside for nearby residents.A master list of 3265 abandoned houses was randomly sorted. From the top of this randomly sorted list, a total of 63 clusters containing 258 abandoned houses were formed and then randomly allocated to 3 study arms. Of the 301 participants interviewed during the preintervention period, 172 (57.1\%) were interviewed during the postintervention period and were included in this analysis; participants were predominantly Black, and most were employed. Study neighborhoods were predominantly Black with high percentages of low-income households. Gun violence outcomes increased in all study arms, but increased the least in the full remediation arm. The full housing remediation arm, compared with the control condition, showed reduced weapons violations by -8.43\% (95\% CI, -14.68\% to -1.19\%), reduced gun assaults by -13.12\% (95\% CI, -21.32\% to -3.01\%), and reduced shootings by a nonsignificant -6.96\% (95\% CI, -15.32\% to 3.03\%). The trash cleanup arm was not associated with a significant differential change in any gun violence outcome. Instances of illegal substance trafficking and use and public drunkenness outcomes were not significantly affected by the housing remediation or trash cleanup treatment. Perceptions of neighborhood safety and time spent outside were unaffected by the intervention. The study arms did differ in a baseline characteristic and some preintervention trends, which raises questions regarding other potential nonmeasured differences between study arms that could have influenced estimates. No evidence of displacement of gun violence outcomes was found.In this cluster randomized controlled trial among low-income, predominantly Black neighborhoods, inexpensive, straightforward abandoned housing remediation was directly linked to significant relative reductions in weapons violations and gun assaults, and suggestive reductions in shootings.isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN14973997},

The historical context in which these eras arose is briefly described. In each era, the public health was at the center of the concerns of the founders and early protagonists of the prevailing paradigm. Around this intellectual development we weave a further theme.
