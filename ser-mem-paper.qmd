## Introduction

At the same time as social epidemiology started to articulate a new vision for place-based and contextual effects to bring back the focus on population health, the formal literature on causal inference as applied to epidemiology was also taking shape. Foundational work by Robins, Greenland, Pearl, Hernan and others in the mid-to-late 1990s. 

In discussing the disappointing results of community-based trials such as COMMIT, Syme remarks on another key idea that helped to motivate a focus on multilevel thinking in social epidemiology:

> If our goal is to prevent disease and promote health, I don't think we can accomplish it by focusing exclusively on individual diseases and risk factors.

Syme covers some of the same ground nearly a decade earlier in a special issue of Daedalus (1994), arguing that a focus on individual-level risk factors is unlikely to be helpful for improving disease, with some evidence from failed trials such as MRFIT to support his view. He also is highly enthusiastic about the recent work of Marmot, specifically regarding the social class "gradient" that exists and can't be explained by traditional risk factors.  

McKinley and Marceau (Lancet 2000):

> The limitations of the risk factor paradigm12, 13 and disappointing results from community-intervention trials aimed at their reduction14, 15 have encouraged researchers to refocus “upstream”16 on the real or underlying reasons for the social patterns of disease.17

McKinley and Marceau (AJPH 1999):

> There are signs of a shift in focus from people to place to social position, which mirrors the different levels of causality behind complex human behavior.


In their historical discussion of the work of Mervyn Susser, Kaufman and Poole [@kaufman2000] identify the tension between pragmatic notions of causal inference present in much of social epidemiologic literature and the formal counterfactual models of causal inference from the statistics literature. 

What about [@merlo2003]?

As Pearce [@pearce1996] noted, much of the problem with 'traditional epidemiology' was its insistence that socioeconomic factors were not 'real' causes of illness.

Impossible to ignore the role that the studies assessing the potential impact of income inequality on health had on the neighborhood effects literature. This was a 'big idea' per the editors of the BMJ. 

Arcaya et al. [@arcaya2016] conducted an innovative systematic review of the *characteristics* of multi-level studies of neighborhood effects. They restricted to studies that used multi-level modeling

Thanks for the invitation to discuss the recent history of multilevel modeling in social epidemiology. I'd like to do a bit of setting the scene, as my co-presenters are here to provide a lot more of the substantive and methodological discussion. So, a bit of background.

Let's go back to the early 1990s, filled with questionable musical genre mash-ups. In many respects this was an exciting time for social epidemiology. Although the roots of social epidemiology trace back to the earliest beginnings of public health and social medicine, emphasis on social factors as causes of disease has ebbed and flowed over the course of the last few centuries. However, during early-to-mid 1990s we witnessed a flood of disciplinary critiques

These critiques found additional support in the conceptual models that were also ubiquitous and in fashion at this time. Virtually all of these conceptual models for understanding the determinants of health placed some primacy on two things. One, that the traditional, individual-centered focus on epidemiology on risk factors for disease was inadequate. Two, that the process of generating distributions of health and disease involved multiple levels, including communities, neighborhoods, municipalities, states, etc. The development, adoption, and use of multilevel statistical models held enormous promise for highlighting and demonstrating the relevance of these new conceptual models, with the aim to bring back the population perspective. 

Credit for early adoption and popularization of these methods should go 

A second strand of work utilizing multi-level models was focused on understanding the potential impact that the degree of economic inequality in society may have for individual health. High profile ecological studies published 

Once the statistical issues had been more-or-less well described, much of the methodological discussions in the social epi literature focused on issues related to how to define neighborhoods, boundaries, how to develop, capture, or measure the relevant dimensions of context. As well as issues related whether and how to control for relevant individual-level variables.
